# Network-graph-using-d3graph-
Created an interactive undirected network graph using d3graph package to visualize the number of scenes shared between two characters. The thickness of the edge between two character nodes represents the number of scenes shared.

You can check out the network graph I created at https://swarnitav08.github.io/Network-graph-using-d3graph-/ hosted on Github pages.

This repository is a part of the visualizations under "The Office Story" project; you can view the project's repo here - https://github.com/swarnitav08/The-Office-Story

## Screenshots:
As far as I have observed the link is best viewed when your browser zoom level is at 100%. The link when opened via Chrome browser on my laptop looks like this(the formatting might change based on different browsers, hence attaching screenshots of how it is supposed to look)-
