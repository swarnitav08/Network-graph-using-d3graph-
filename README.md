# Network-graph-using-d3graph-
Created an interactive undirected network graph using d3graph package to visualize the number of scenes shared between two characters. The thickness of the edge between two character nodes represents the number of scenes shared.

You can check out the network graph I created at https://swarnitav08.github.io/Network-graph-using-d3graph-/ hosted on Github pages.

## Screenshots:

The link when opened via Chrome browser on my laptop Dell Inspiron 5559 (15.6-inch) looks like this (the formatting might change based on different laptop screens and browsers, hence attaching screenshots of how it is supposed to look)-
